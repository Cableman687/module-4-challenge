# module-4-challenge

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- The motivation to complete this challenge was to test my own skills gained in the most recent week of the coding bootcamp, including but not limited to; Intervals, Listeners, Events, bubbling, Data Attributes and many more.
- This project was built as a testing ground for my own retention of the aforementioned skills.

- This software allows users to engage in a simple quiz designed to test basic coding principles, and act as a stepping-off point into more complex ideas.
- Through building this application, I learnt that there are many programming skills outside of what we learn throughout the week, and that research and collaboration is critical in order to achieve the best outcome for each project.
